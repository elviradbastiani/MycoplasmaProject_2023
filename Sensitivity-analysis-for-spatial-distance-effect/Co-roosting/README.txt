# Co-roosting: Testing Data for Spatial Distance Effect
Co-roosting network: A roosting interaction is recorded when two vultures are within 25 meters of one another while not flying during the night (Figure 4b in the main manuscript). Since individuals are tracked only during the day, interactions during the night are determined by the last position of the day, if not by the first position of the following morning. We exclude interactions that occur within roosting areas during the daytime. We distinguished between direct and indirect social interactions, as outlined in Table 1 in the main manuscript. For roosting interactions, we classified an interaction as direct if vultures were within 25 meters of each other for a single night. Indirect interactions were defined when the positions of two vultures were within 25 meters, persisting for more than one night during roosting. We examined predictions using alternative distance values (meters = {10, 25, 50, 75, 100}), with further details available in the supplementary material, specifically in Table S1-S4 and Figure S1-S8.
