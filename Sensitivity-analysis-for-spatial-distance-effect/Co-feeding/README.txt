# Co-feeding: Testing Data for Spatial Distance Effect
Co-feeding network: A feeding interaction is recorded when two vultures are within 25 meters of one another, not flying (i.e., moving at a speed of less than 5 m/s), during the day (Figure 4a in the main manuscript). We distinguished between direct and indirect social interactions, as outlined in Table 1 in the main manuscript. Direct interactions were identified when two vultures were within 25 meters while feeding, with a separation of 30 minutes or less between these positions. Indirect interactions were defined when the positions of two vultures were within 25 meters while feeding, but at least 4 hours elapsed between the two GPS fixes. Since the incubation period of Mycoplasma can vary depending on the specific species/strain and the host's immune system response, typically ranging from 2 to 3 days up to 23 days, we used 14 days as the midpoint of this range. Additionally, we analyzed predictions under other values of the incubation period of Mycoplasma days (days = {7, 14, 21, 28}) (see details in the supplementary material Table S1-S4 and Figure S1-S8).
