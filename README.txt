Running headline: Social interactions do not shape infection status

Abstract: Uncovering the ways in which pathogens spread has important implications for population health and management. Pathogen transmission is influenced by various factors, including the patterns of social interactions and shared use of space. We aim to understand how the social behavior of griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus), a species of conservation interest, affects the probability of being infected with a bacterium (Mycoplasma spp.) known to cause respiratory disease in birds. We investigated how these vultures become infected and how direct and indirect social interactions in different social situations may affect the spread of the pathogen within a wild host population. We inferred interactions from high-resolution GPS tracking data. Specifically, we assessed how social behavior affects the likelihood of vultures to become infected in two social situations: when vultures share feeding and roosting locations, either at the same time (direct interactions) or subsequently when space use is asynchronous (indirect interactions). Despite conducting a broad sensitivity analysis for estimated parameters, we did not detect a significant effect of any type of social interaction on the likelihood of vultures to become infected with mycoplasma. However, we observed a high prevalence of mycoplasma, with younger birds exhibiting a tendency to be more susceptible to infection than adults. This susceptibility is likely attributed to the underdeveloped immune system in younger birds. As the immune system matures and acquires the ability to recognize and effectively respond to specific pathogens, adults become less susceptible to mycoplasma infection. Our inability to identify an effect of social interactions on being infected with a pathogen suggests that other factors might be more important in determining disease dynamics in some systems. Linking social networks and their joint impacts on infectious diseases is crucial for maintaining viable wildlife populations, planning disease prevention, containment management actions, and gaining insights into the ecological and evolutionary processes that drive the persistence of infectious diseases.
