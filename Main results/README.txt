Supplementar information S4:
Data for main results: We examined direct social interactions of griffon vultures when roosting (Figure 1a, Table 1-3). To infer the interaction we used GPS-tracking data from the 14-day period preceding the capture and sampling of vultures for mycoplasma for building a social network (Figure 1c). In our tracking dataset we observed a total of 106 individuals interacting while feeding and 114 individuals interacting while roosting. We examined the relationship between social behavior and infection status considering mycoplasma identification at the genus level.
